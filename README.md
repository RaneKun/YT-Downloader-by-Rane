# YT-Downloader-by-Rane
A simple yet powerful YouTube downloader built around [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
. This tool lets you download videos, audio, and thumbnails from YouTube with ease, while preserving proper metadata for all supported formats (.mp4, .opus, .webp).

It also supports batch processing, so you can queue multiple links or playlists and let the tool handle everything automatically.

In addition, it comes bundled with a video compression option powered by [HandBrakeCLI](https://handbrake.fr/)
. This is especially useful if you want to reduce the size of downloaded videos without losing much quality.

Whether you want clean audio files, original thumbnails, or smaller compressed video files, this project provides a streamlined workflow with minimal setup.
